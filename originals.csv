Le Lutin qui rit,45.94335,-71.98897,Warwick,"Restaurateur Fernand Lachance of Le Café Ideal (later Le Lutin qui rit), is said to have exclaimed in 1957, ""ça va faire une maudite poutine!"" (English: ""It will make a damn mess!"") when asked by a regular to put a handful of cheese curds in a take-out bag of french fries. The dish ""poutine"" appears on the establishment's 1957 menu. Lachance served this on a plate, and beginning in 1962 added hot gravy to keep it warm."
Le Roy Jucep,45.8865,-72.50565,Drummondville,"This drive-in restaurant served french fries with gravy, to which some customers would add a side order of cheese curds. Owner Jean-Paul Roy began serving the combination in 1958 and added it to the menu in 1964 as ""fromage-patate-sauce"". Felt to be too long a name, this was later changed to poutine for a cook nicknamed ""Ti-Pout"" and a slang word for ""pudding"". The restaurant displays a copyright registration certificate, issued by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, which alludes to Roy having invented poutine."
La Petite Vache,46.16919,-71.86965,Prineville,"Customers would mix cheese curds with their fries, a combination which was added to the menu. One option included gravy and was called the ""Mixte""."
